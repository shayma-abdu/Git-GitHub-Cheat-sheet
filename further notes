* branches are labels
* master is the main branch
* head is the commit that you are currently in
* "detached head" means looking at a commit that wasnt labeled with a branch name
* each commit stores a reference of its parent commit
* after fixing a merge conflict, you still need to add the conflict fixes and then commit it to conclude the merge
* you could use git checkout branch_name to checkout a remote branch created by other collaborators.
